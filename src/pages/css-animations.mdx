# CSS Animations

## Objective:

Learn how to create and apply CSS animations to HTML elements using `@keyframes` and animation properties like `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, and `animation-timing-function`.

### **Instructions**

1. Create an HTML file named `css-animations.html`.
2. Link a CSS file named `css-animations.css`.
3. Complete the following tasks by applying animations to various elements.

---

### **Tasks:**

### **Task 1: Basic Animation**

- Create a `<div>` with the class `bouncing-box`.
- Animate the `<div>` to move up and down vertically in a continuous loop.
- Use the following properties:
  - `animation-name`: `bounce`
  - `animation-duration`: `2s`
  - `animation-iteration-count`: `infinite`

### **Task 2: Color Change Animation**

- Create a `<button>` with the text "Hover Over Me!" and the class `color-change-btn`.
- Add an animation that changes the button's background color through three colors (e.g., red, yellow, and green) when hovered over.
- Use the `:hover` pseudo-class to trigger the animation.

### **Task 3: Rotate Animation**

- Create an `<img>` with the class `rotating-image` and any image of your choice.
- Animate the image to rotate 360 degrees continuously.
- Use the following properties:
  - `animation-name`: `rotate`
  - `animation-duration`: `5s`
  - `animation-timing-function`: `linear`
  - `animation-iteration-count`: `infinite`

### **Task 4: Fading Text Animation**

- Create a `<p>` element with the class `fading-text` and the text "CSS Animations are Fun!".
- Animate the text to fade in and out smoothly in a loop.
- Use the following properties:
  - `animation-name`: `fade`
  - `animation-duration`: `3s`
  - `animation-iteration-count`: `infinite`

### **Task 5: Combined Animation**

- Create a `<div>` with the class `combined-animation-box`.
- Animate this `<div>` to:
  1. Move from left to right across the screen.
  2. Scale up in size.
  3. Change its background color.
- Use the following properties:
  - `animation-name`: `move-scale-color`
  - `animation-duration`: `4s`
  - `animation-timing-function`: `ease-in-out`
