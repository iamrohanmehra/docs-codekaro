# Introduction to HTML

### Objective:

Practice and demonstrate your understanding of HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, anchor tags, media tags (image, video, and audio), and embedding external content like YouTube and Instagram posts. You'll also learn to create functional links using `mailto:`, `tel:`, and `wa.me`, along with incorporating external media into your webpage.

**1. Heading**

- Use the `<h1>` tag to create a **main heading** for your page, welcoming visitors to your assignment project.

**2. Paragraph**

- Use the `<p>` tag to create a **paragraph** that briefly describes your assignment.
  - Provide information about the purpose and content of the project.

**3. Anchor Tags**

- Create a **list** using `<ul>` and `<li>` tags with four items, each containing an anchor (`<a>`) tag:
  1. **Email Address**
     - Link to your email address using the `mailto:` attribute.
  2. **Phone Number**
     - Link to a phone number using the `tel:` attribute.
  3. **WhatsApp Message**
     - Link to a WhatsApp message using the URL: `https://wa.me/`.
  4. **External Website**
     - Link to an external website, ensuring it opens in a **new tab** by using `target="_blank"`.

**4. Image Tag**

- Use the `<img>` tag to insert an **image** into your project:
  - Set the `alt` attribute to provide a description of the image.

**5. Video Tag**

- Use the `<video>` tag to **embed a video** in your project:
  - Include controls for **play, pause, and volume**.
  - Use either a local video file or an online source.

**6. Audio Tag**

- Use the `<audio>` tag to add an **audio file** to your project:
  - Provide controls for **play, pause, and volume**.
  - Use either a local audio file or an online source.

**7. Embedding a YouTube Video**

- Use the `<iframe>` tag to embed a **YouTube video** on your page:
  - Get the embed code from YouTube and paste it into your project.

**8. Embedding an Instagram Post**

- Embed an **Instagram post** on your page using:
  - The `<blockquote>` tag for the post content.
  - The `<script>` tag for the embed functionality.
  - Get the embed code from the Instagram post you want to display.
