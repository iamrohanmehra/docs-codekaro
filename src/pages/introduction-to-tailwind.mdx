### **Assignment Guidelines:**

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Use the Tailwind CSS CDN for simplicity, or set up a local Tailwind environment with npm.
   - Ensure your HTML files are linked correctly to use Tailwind CSS classes.
2. **File Structure:**
   - Create a folder with the following files:
     - `index.html` (Main file linking to the card pages)
     - `card1.html`, `card2.html`, `card3.html` (Separate files for each card)
3. **Design Requirements:**
   - Each card must:
     - Be centered vertically and horizontally using Tailwind utilities.
     - Match the design's fonts, colors, shadows, and layouts as closely as possible.
     - Use Tailwind's utility classes for responsiveness, typography, and hover effects.
   - Add responsive behavior (e.g., adjust size and spacing for smaller screens).
4. **Index Page (`index.html`):**
   - Create links to navigate to each card (`card1.html`, `card2.html`, `card3.html`).
   - Style the links using Tailwind classes (`text-lg`, `text-blue-500`, `hover:underline`, etc.).
5. **Individual Cards:**
   - Each card should:
     - Feature its own unique style but remain consistent with the design theme.
     - Be built entirely with Tailwind CSS (no external CSS).
     - Include at least:
       - A heading or title
       - A short description
       - One or more buttons with hover effects
6. **Styling with Tailwind:**
   - Typography: Use `font-sans`, `font-bold`, `text-xl`, etc.
   - Layout: Use `flex`, `grid`, or `container` utilities for structure.
   - Spacing: Apply `p-4`, `m-6`, `gap-4` for margins, padding, and spacing.
   - Colors: Use Tailwind's color palette (`bg-blue-500`, `text-gray-700`, etc.).
   - Shadows: Enhance cards with utilities like `shadow-md`, `shadow-lg`.
   - Hover Effects: Use `hover:bg-opacity-75`, `hover:scale-105`, etc.

### **Instructions:**

- **Files Required:**
  - `index.html`, `card1.html`, `card2.html`, `card3.html`
- **Design Goals:**
  - Replicate the Dribbble design as closely as possible.
  - Ensure all links in `index.html` work correctly and navigate to the respective card pages.
  - Cards must be responsive and visually appealing across screen sizes.
- **Folder Organization:**
  - Place all files in a single folder for easy submission and testing.

### **Extra Tips:**

- Use **Google Fonts** for typography if needed.
- Use Tailwind's online documentation for additional utilities: [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
