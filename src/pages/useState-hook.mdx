# useState Hook

## **Objective:**

Create a simple Like Button application to practice state management using the `useState` hook.

---

### **Task:**

1. Create a React component called `LikeButtonApp`.
2. Use the `useState` hook to manage the number of likes.
3. Add the following features:
   - A button labeled **"Like"**.
   - Display the current number of likes above or next to the button.
   - Each click on the "Like" button should increase the like count by 1.

---

**Bonus Challenge (Optional):**

Add a second button labeled **"Unlike"**, which decreases the like count but does not allow the count to go below 0.
