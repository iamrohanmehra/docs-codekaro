# JavaScript Foundations

1. **Log a Message to the Console**
   - Use `console.log()` to display a custom message, like `"Hello, JavaScript World!"`, in your browser's console.
   - Open the Developer Console (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+J`) and check if the message appears.
2. **Create an Alert Box**
   - Write an `alert()` statement with a message that includes your name, such as `alert("Hello from [Your Name]!");`.
   - Refresh the page to see the alert pop up and observe where it displays on your screen.
3. **Exploring `let` and `const`**
   - Declare a variable with `let` (e.g., `let age = 25;`) and change its value on the next line (e.g., `age = 26;`).
   - Declare a variable with `const` (e.g., `const birthYear = 2000;`) and then try to change it (e.g., `birthYear = 2001;`).
   - Observe the error message that appears when modifying `const`, and note how `let` and `const` behave differently.
