# CSS FlexBox

## **Objective:**

  [Google Instagram Page](https://www.instagram.com/google)
- Create a static, non-responsive replica of the design for **laptop screens only**.

---

## **Steps to Complete the Assignment**

### 1. **Install SVG Grabber**

- To extract the icons from the Instagram page, install the **SVG Grabber** Chrome extension:[SVG Grabber - Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/svg-grabber-get-all-the-s/eafjmnaiohflfhelegodfedimibnjpgp?hl=en-GB&utm_source=ext_sidebarr)
- Use the extension to download all the icons used on the page (e.g., the Instagram logo, verified badge, post icons like heart, comment, share, etc.).

### 2. **File Structure**

- Create a project folder with the following files:
  - `index.html`: Contains the main structure of the page.
  - `styles.css`: Contains all the styling for the page.
  - `icons/`: A folder where you will save all the extracted SVG icons.

### 3. **Design Requirements**

- **Layout:**
  - Use HTML and CSS to replicate the **default desktop view** of the page.
  - Include the following sections:
    1. **Header:** Profile picture, username, verified badge, and buttons (Follow, Message, etc.).
    2. **Stats Section:** Posts, Followers, Following.
    3. **Bio Section:** Include the bio text, links, and emojis as they appear.
    4. **Highlights Section:** Add circular highlight placeholders below the bio.
    5. **Posts Section:** Display the posts in a grid format (3 posts per row).
- **Styling:**
  - Match the fonts, colors, and alignment as closely as possible.
  - Use tools like **Google Fonts** to match typography.
  - Use CSS properties for layout, such as `grid` or `flexbox`, for the post section.
- **Icons:**
  - Replace icons on the page (e.g., like, comment, save, etc.) with the SVGs downloaded using SVG Grabber.
- **Images:**
  - You can use placeholder images for the posts. Download some square images to replicate the grid layout.

### 4. **Technical Notes**

- **No Responsiveness Required:**
  - Focus on a static design for laptop screens (e.g., 1440px width).
  - Use a fixed layout with appropriate margins and paddings.
- **Static Data:**
  - No need to fetch real-time data; use placeholder text for posts, followers, and following stats.
