# Advance Array & Objects

### **Objective**:

Use advanced JavaScript array and object methods to create a simple program that manages a collection of books.

### **Task**:

1. **Create an Initial Array of Books**:

   Each book should be an object with the following properties:

   - `title` (string)
   - `author` (string)
   - `publishedYear` (number)

   Example:

   ```js {{title: "js"}}
   const books = [
     { title: 'Book A', author: 'Author 1', publishedYear: 2000 },
     { title: 'Book B', author: 'Author 2', publishedYear: 2005 },
     { title: 'Book C', author: 'Author 3', publishedYear: 2010 },
   ]
   ```

2. **Perform the Following Operations**:
   - **Add a New Book**: Use `unshift` to add a new book to the beginning of the array.
   - **Remove the Oldest Book**: Use `shift` to remove the first book.
   - **Find a Book by Title**: Use `find` to search for a book by its title (hardcode the title for now).
   - **List Books by a Specific Author**: Use `filter` to get all books written by a particular author.
   - **Check for Recent Books**: Use `some` to check if there are any books published in the last 5 years.
   - **Create a New Array with Titles Only**: Use `map` to create a new array that contains only the titles of the books.
   - **Make a Shallow Copy of the Array**: Use the spread operator to create a shallow copy of the `books` array.
   - **Combine Two Arrays**: Create a second array of books and use `concat` to combine it with the existing array.
3. **Bonus Challenge (Optional)**:
   - Implement a deep copy of the `books` array using structured cloning or JSON methods.
   - Use `toSpliced` to replace or remove a book in the array.

### **Output Example**:

After performing the operations, the console should display:

1. The updated book list.
2. The found book (if any).
3. Books by the specified author.
4. Whether there are any recent books.
5. The titles array.
