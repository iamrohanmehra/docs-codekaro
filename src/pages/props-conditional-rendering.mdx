# Props & Conditional Rendering

## **Objective:**

In this assignment, you will practice working with props, mapping data, and implementing conditional rendering in React. You will create a functional component to display details of tourist places and render them dynamically using data passed as props.

---

### **Instructions:**

### **1. Create the `TouristPlace` Component**

- Create a new React component named `TouristPlace`.
- This component should:
  - Accept props.
  - Display details of a tourist place (name, description, image, price, ratings, and the best season to visit).

### **2. Render Data Using Props and `map`**

- In your main `App` component or a dedicated parent component:
  1. Define an array of objects to represent different tourist places (sample data is provided below).
  2. Use the `map` function to iterate over this array and render a `TouristPlace` component for each tourist place.
  3. Pass the relevant data for each place as props to the `TouristPlace` component.

### **3. Add Conditional Rendering**

Enhance your `TouristPlace` component with the following conditional rendering logic:

1. **Price Indicator:**
   - If the price is less than 12,000, display **"Cheaper"**.
   - If the price is 12,000 or more, display **"Expensive"**.
2. **Seasonal Highlight:**
   - Highlight whether the place is best to visit in **"Summer"** or **"Winter"** based on the `whenToVisit` property.

### **Sample Data**

Use the following array of objects to represent tourist places in India:

```jsx {{title: "jsx"}}
const touristPlaces = [
  {
    placeName: 'Goa',
    desc: 'Famous for its beaches, nightlife, and Portuguese heritage.',
    img: 'link_to_goa_image',
    whenToVisit: 'Winter',
    ratings: 4.5,
    price: 15000,
  },
  {
    placeName: 'Manali',
    desc: 'A high-altitude Himalayan resort town known for its cool climate and snow-capped mountains.',
    img: 'link_to_manali_image',
    whenToVisit: 'Summer',
    ratings: 4.7,
    price: 10000,
  },
  {
    placeName: 'Kerala',
    desc: 'Known for its palm-lined beaches, backwaters, and rich traditions.',
    img: 'link_to_kerala_image',
    whenToVisit: 'Winter',
    ratings: 4.8,
    price: 20000,
  },
  {
    placeName: 'Jaipur',
    desc: 'The capital of Rajasthan, known for its historic palaces and vibrant culture.',
    img: 'link_to_jaipur_image',
    whenToVisit: 'Winter',
    ratings: 4.6,
    price: 12000,
  },
]
```

### **Expected Features**

- Use **props** to pass data from the parent component to the `TouristPlace` component.
- Render all the tourist places dynamically using the **`map`** function.
- Use **conditional rendering** to:
  - Display whether a place is **"Cheaper"** or **"Expensive"** based on its price.
  - Highlight whether the place is ideal to visit in **"Summer"** or **"Winter"**.

### **Bonus Task (Optional)**

1. Add CSS styling to make the tourist places visually appealing.
2. Use a `div` with a class like `place-card` to style each `TouristPlace`.
