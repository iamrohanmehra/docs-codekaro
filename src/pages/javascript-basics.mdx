# JavaScript Basics

### Part 1: Array Methods

1. **Push and Pop**
   - Create an array of your favorite fruits (e.g., `["apple", "banana", "mango"]`).
   - Add two more fruits to the array.
   - Remove the last fruit from the array.
   - Log the updated array to the console.
2. **Using Splice**
   - Start with an array of numbers from 1 to 5 (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`).
   - Insert the number `6` after the third element.
   - Remove the second element from the array.
   - Log the final array.

### Part 2: Array of Objects

1. **Manipulate an Array of Objects**
   - Create an array of objects where each object represents a person with properties `name` and `age`. Example:
     ```js {{ title: 'js' }}
     const people = [
       { name: 'Alice', age: 25 },
       { name: 'Bob', age: 30 },
       { name: 'Charlie', age: 35 },
     ]
     ```
   - Add a new person to the array.
   - Remove the last person from the array.
   - Log the updated array.

### Part 3: Conditional Statements

1. **If-Else Statement**
   - Create a variable `score` with a value between 0 and 100.
   - Write an `if-else` statement:
     - If the score is greater than or equal to 90, log `"Grade: A"`.
     - If the score is between 80 and 89, log `"Grade: B"`.
     - If the score is between 70 and 79, log `"Grade: C"`.
     - Otherwise, log `"Grade: F"`.
2. **Ternary Operator**
   - Rewrite the above grading logic using a ternary operator to determine and log the grade.
   - Hint: Use nested ternary operators.
