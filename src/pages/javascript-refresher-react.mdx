# JavaScript Refresher for React

## **Objective:**

Practice JavaScript concepts (arrow functions, import/export, template literals, ternary operators, destructuring, array mapping, and filters).

### **Task:**

1. Create an array of at least 5 objects representing movies. Each movie should have:
   - `title` (string)
   - `year` (number)
   - `rating` (number between 1-10)
   - `genre` (string, e.g., "Action," "Drama")
   - `isWatched` (boolean)
2. **Part 1:** Movie List
   - Use `map()` to create a list of movie titles with their year in a formatted string (e.g., "Inception (2010)"). Display this list in the console.
3. **Part 2:** Filtering Movies
   - Use `filter()` to create a list of movies with a rating of 8 or higher.
   - Display this list in a formatted string: `"Title: Inception | Year: 2010 | Rating: 8.8"`
4. **Part 3:** Ternary for Watched Status
   - Display whether each movie has been watched using a ternary operator: `"You have watched Inception"` or `"You need to watch Inception."`
5. **Part 4:** Use Destructuring
   - Destructure the `title` and `rating` of each movie and log a summary: `"Inception has a rating of 8.8"`
6. **Bonus:** Modularize Code
   - Create a module to export the array of movies and import it into your main file.
