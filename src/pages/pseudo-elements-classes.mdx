# Pseudo Elements & Classes

### Objective:

Practice using pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) and pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:nth-child`, `:first-child`, etc.) to style elements dynamically and creatively.

---

### Instructions:

1. Create a new HTML file named `pseudo-elements-classes.html`.
2. Link a CSS file named `pseudo-elements-classes.css`.
3. Complete the tasks below using proper HTML structure and CSS styles.

---

### Tasks:

### **Part 1: Pseudo-Elements (`::before` and `::after`)**

1. **Add Decorative Text with `::before`:**
   - Create an `<h1>` with the text: "Welcome to Pseudo World!"
   - Use `::before` to add a star (`★`) before the text.
   - Style the star with a golden color.
2. **Add Decorative Text with `::after`:**
   - Create a `<p>` with the text: "CSS is magical."
   - Use `::after` to add a sparkle (`✨`) at the end of the text.
   - Style the sparkle with a bright yellow color.

### **Part 2: Pseudo-Classes**

1. **Hover Effect with `:hover`:**
   - Create a `<button>` with the text: "Hover Me!"
   - Use the `:hover` pseudo-class to change the background color and text color when the button is hovered.
2. **Style List Items with `:nth-child`:**
   - Create an unordered list `<ul>` with 5 items: "Item 1", "Item 2", ..., "Item 5".
   - Use `:nth-child` to:
     - Apply a different background color to odd-numbered items.
     - Apply a bold font style to the third item.
3. **Highlight the First and Last Child:**
   - Create a `<div>` with 3 child `<p>` elements, each containing some text (e.g., "First Paragraph", "Middle Paragraph", "Last Paragraph").
   - Use `:first-child` to style the first `<p>` with a green border.
   - Use `:last-child` to style the last `<p>` with a red border.
