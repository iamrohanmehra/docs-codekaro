# HTML Assignment: Structuring Content

### Objective:

Practice creating and structuring HTML content using **tables**, **lists**, and **forms**. You will also learn to implement validation on form fields to enhance user input handling and ensure data accuracy. This assignment will help you gain a deeper understanding of HTML elements and attributes, including form validation techniques.

**1. Table Creation**

- Create an **HTML table** with the following specifications:
  - At least **3 columns** and **4 rows**.
  - Use the following table elements:
    - `<table>` for defining the table.
    - `<tr>` for each table row.
    - `<th>` for table headers.
    - `<td>` for table data.
  - Populate the table with meaningful data. Example:
    - Create a table displaying information about fruits:
      - Columns: **Name**, **Color**, **Taste**.
      - Rows: Different fruits with their details.

**2. Unordered List (`<ul>`)**

- Below the table, create an **unordered list (ul)**:
  - Add at least **5 list items (li)**.
  - Each list item can describe your choice of topic. Example:
    - List your favorite movies, books, or places to visit.

**3. Ordered List (`<ol>`)**

- Following the unordered list, create an **ordered list (ol)**:
  - Add at least **3 list items**.
  - Represent a process or a ranking of items. Example:
    - Steps for preparing a recipe.
    - Your top priorities for the week.

**4. Form Creation with Enhanced Validation**

- Design a simple **HTML form** with the following fields:
  - **Name Input:**
    - Text input for the userâ€™s name.
    - Validation:
      - `minlength="3"`
      - `maxlength="50"`.
  - **Email Input:**
    - Email input field with the `required` attribute.
    - Add a placeholder for user guidance.
  - **Gender Selection:**
    - Radio buttons for gender options:
      - Male, Female, Other.
  - **Age Range Drop-down:**
    - A drop-down menu (`<select>` element) with options such as:
      - 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, etc.
  - **Newsletter Opt-In:**
    - A checkbox allowing users to opt into a newsletter.
  - **Submit Button:**
    - Add a submit button to allow the form submission.

**5. Validation**

- Implement basic form validation using HTML attributes:
  - **Name Field:** Ensure it meets the specified `minlength` and `maxlength` criteria.
  - **Email Field:** Use the `required` attribute to ensure the field cannot be left empty.
  - **Gender Selection:** Validate that at least one gender option is selected.
  - Use attributes such as `required`, `minlength`, and `maxlength` effectively.

### Note:

- Test all links, tables, lists, and forms to ensure they work as expected.
