# React Forms

## **Objective:**

In this assignment, you will apply your knowledge of **React Forms**, including **useRef**, **controlled components**, and **React Hook Form**. You will create two mini-projects:

1. **BMI Calculator App**: A form that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input.
2. **To-Do App**: A simple to-do list app with add task functionality.

## **Assignment Breakdown:**

### **1. BMI Calculator App**

**Objective:** Build a BMI calculator where users can input their weight and height to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI).

**Requirements:**

- **Form Setup:**
  - Create a form with two input fields: one for weight (in kg) and one for height (in meters).
  - Use **controlled components** for both inputs (using `useState`).
  - Optionally, use **useRef** to access the input fields for focus management or validation (if necessary).
- **Calculate BMI:**
  - Create a button to calculate the BMI when clicked.
  - Display the BMI result below the form after clicking the button.
- **Validation:**
  - Use **React Hook Form** for form validation. Make sure the weight and height fields are required and are valid numbers.
- **BMI Categories:**
  - After calculating the BMI, categorize the result into different BMI categories (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) and display the category.

**UI Design:** Keep it simple and focus on functionality.

### **2. To-Do App with Add Task Functionality**

**Objective:** Build a simple to-do list app where users can add tasks to a list.

**Requirements:**

- **Form Setup:**
  - Create a form with a single input field to add a new task.
  - Use **controlled components** to manage the input field state.
  - Optionally, use **useRef** to manage focus on the input field after adding a task.
- **Add Task Functionality:**
  - When the user submits the form, the task should be added to a list below the input field.
  - Display each task with its name in the list.
- **Clear Input After Submit:**
  - Once a task is added, clear the input field using **React Hook Form** or manual state management (e.g., setting the input field value to an empty string after submission).
- **Task Removal:**
  - Provide a way to delete tasks from the list. Use a button next to each task to remove it.
- **Task Completion (Optional):**
  - Allow users to mark tasks as completed by clicking a checkbox next to the task. When checked, the task should have a strikethrough style.

**UI Design:** Keep the design simple and user-friendly.

## **Instructions:**

1. **Setup Your React App:**
   - Use `create-react-app` or any other preferred setup method for both apps.
   - Install **React Hook Form** for the BMI app to manage form validation.
2. **Build the BMI Calculator:**
   - Implement the input fields and calculate BMI logic.
   - Use **useState** for controlled components and **useRef** (if necessary).
   - Use **React Hook Form** for validation and handling the form submission.
   - Display the BMI result and categorize it accordingly.
3. **Build the To-Do App:**
   - Implement the input field for adding tasks.
   - Use **useState** for managing the list of tasks.
   - Add functionality for deleting tasks and optionally marking them as completed.
4. **Focus on Functionality:**
   - Ensure that both apps are functional and user-friendly.
   - Make sure all form fields are validated and handle edge cases (e.g., empty inputs).
