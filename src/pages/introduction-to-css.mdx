### **File Structure:**

1. **Main File (`index.html`):**
   - Create a main file named `index.html`.
   - This file should contain three **links** to the card pages:
     - **Card 1:** Link to `card1.html`.
     - **Card 2:** Link to `card2.html`.
     - **Card 3:** Link to `card3.html`.
   - Use a simple layout with all links styled appropriately (e.g., centered and visually appealing).
2. **Card Files:**
   - Create **three separate HTML files**:
     - `card1.html`
     - `card2.html`
     - `card3.html`
   - Each file should contain **one card**, centered in the viewport.
   - The card design must match the corresponding design from the Dribbble link.

### **Design Guidelines:**

1. **CSS Styling:**
   - Use CSS for layout and styling to replicate the design as closely as possible.
   - Focus on:
     - Font styles and sizes.
     - Colors, gradients, and shadows.
     - Button styles, shapes, and hover effects.
   - Include responsive design if possible.
2. **Card Positioning:**
   - Each card should be:
     - Centered both vertically and horizontally on the page.
     - Use CSS properties like `display: flex`, `justify-content: center`, and `align-items: center` to achieve this.
3. **File Linking:**
   - Ensure the **links in the `index.html` file** navigate correctly to the respective card pages (`card1.html`, `card2.html`, `card3.html`).
4. **File Organization:**
   - All files (`index.html`, `card1.html`, `card2.html`, `card3.html`, and CSS file) should be placed in the same project folder for easy access and testing.

### **Tips for Success:**

- Use the browser's developer tools to inspect and understand the design elements in the Dribbble link.
- Pay attention to spacing, alignment, and typography.
- Use external libraries like **Google Fonts** if needed for matching the font styles.
- Validate your HTML and CSS for errors.
