# Functions & Loops

### Part 1: Functions

1. **Function Declaration**
   - Create a function named `greet` that takes a name as a parameter and logs a message like `"Hello, [Name]!"` to the console.
   - Call the function with different names and observe the output.
2. **Arrow Function**
   - Write an arrow function named `multiply` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their product.
   - Call the function with various numbers and log the results.
3. **Function with Default Parameters**
   - Create a function named `calculateArea` that calculates the area of a rectangle. Use default values for the width and height.
   - Call the function with and without arguments and log the results.

### Part 2: Loops

1. **For Loop**
   - Create an array of numbers. Write a `for` loop to calculate the sum of all numbers in the array.
   - Log the final sum to the console.
2. **Using `forEach`**
   - Create an array of strings (e.g., names of colors or fruits). Use `forEach` to log each item in the array with a message like `"Item: [item]"`.
3. **Nested Loop (Moderate)**

   - Create a function named `printGrid` that takes a number `n` as input and prints an `n x n` grid of asterisks (\*) using nested `for` loops.
   - For example, calling `printGrid(3)` should display:

     ```bash {{title: "bash"}}
     ***
     ***
     ***
     ```

**Bonus Challenge (Optional)**

1. **Combining Functions and Loops**
   - Write a function named `findEvenNumbers` that takes an array of numbers as input.
   - Use a `for` loop to find and return all even numbers in the array.
   - Log the result when calling the function with different arrays.
