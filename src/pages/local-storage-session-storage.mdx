# Local Storage & Session Storage

### **Assignment: Favorite Color Picker**

## **Objective**:

Use `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` to create a simple app that saves and displays the user's favorite color preferences.

### **Task**:

1. Create a form with a dropdown or input field where the user can select or type their favorite color.
2. Display the selected favorite color on the screen.

---

### **Requirements**:

### **1. Using `localStorage`**:

- Save the user's favorite color in `localStorage`.
- When the page is refreshed or reopened later, retrieve the color from `localStorage` and display it.

### **2. Using `sessionStorage`**:

- Keep track of how many times the user changes their favorite color during the current session.
- Display the count of changes on the screen.

---

### **Bonus Challenge (Optional)**:

- Add a button to reset both the `localStorage` (to remove the saved color) and the `sessionStorage` (to reset the change count).
