# Asynchronous JS & API’s

### **Objective**:

Create a profile card using the [`https://randomuser.me/api`](https://randomuser.me/api) API to fetch random user data and display it in a visually appealing card format.

---

### **Instructions**:

1. **Fetch Data from the API**:

   Use the `fetch` function to get data from the Random User API. The data should include:

   - Full name (first and last)
   - Profile picture
   - Gender
   - Date of birth (formatted as DD-MM-YYYY)
   - Email
   - Location (city, state, country)

2. **Display the Data**:

   Create a simple profile card with the fetched data. The card should include:

   - The user’s profile picture at the top.
   - Full name and gender below the picture.
   - Date of birth, email, and location in a neatly styled section.

3. **Styling**:

   Use basic CSS to make the profile card look clean and professional.

4. **Get a Random Profile**:

   Add a button that fetches and displays a new random profile when clicked.

5. **Error Handling (Optional)**:

   Implement error handling using `.catch` to display a friendly message if the data fetching fails.

### **Sample Output (For Reference)**:

### Profile Card Layout:

- **Image**: User's profile picture at the top.
- **Text Section**: Below the image, show the full name, gender, DOB, email, and location.
