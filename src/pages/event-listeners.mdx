# Event Listeners

## **Objective:**

Create a simple form that reacts to various events, such as mouse events, keyboard input, and scrolling. This will demonstrate the use of `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`, `addEventListener`, and other event listeners like `onmouseenter`, `onmouseleave`, `onkeyup`, `onkeydown`, and `scroll`.

### **Task Instructions:**

1. **Create the HTML Structure:**
   - Create a form with the following fields:
     - A text input for the user's name (with a placeholder "Enter your name").
     - A checkbox for subscribing to a newsletter (labeled "Subscribe to newsletter").
     - A dropdown menu with options for selecting a favorite color.
     - A submit button.
   - Create a separate `div` that will display feedback messages based on user interactions.
2. **Event Listeners:**
   - **Text Input:**
     - Add an event listener for the `onkeyup` event.
     - When the user types in the text input, update a `div` with a message like "Hello, [name]!" based on the input.
   - **Checkbox:**
     - Add an event listener for the `onchange` event.
     - When the user checks or unchecks the checkbox, display a message in the `div` saying either "Subscribed!" or "Unsubscribed!".
   - **Dropdown (Select):**
     - Add an event listener for the `onchange` event.
     - When the user selects a color from the dropdown, change the background color of the form to the selected color and display a message in the `div` saying "Your favorite color is [color]!".
   - **Mouse Events on Submit Button:**
     - Add event listeners for `onmouseenter` and `onmouseleave` events on the submit button.
     - When the mouse enters the button, change its background color to green, and when it leaves, change it back to its original color.
   - **Scroll Event:**
     - Add an event listener for the `scroll` event.
     - When the user scrolls the page, display a message in the `div` saying "You are scrolling!".
   - **Window Load Event:**
     - Add an event listener for the `load` event to change the background color of the form when the page loads (for example, change it to light gray).
3. **Form Validation (Optional):**
   - If the user tries to submit the form without entering their name, display an alert with the message "Please enter your name!" and prevent form submission.
